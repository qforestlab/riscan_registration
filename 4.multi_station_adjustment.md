**2. Multi Station Adjustment 2 (MSA2)**
<br>
The MSA 2 module is used to refine the initial coarse co-registration that is
provided by the Automatic Registration 2 module. In the particular configuration
that will be used here, this is undertaken by matching planes generated from
every point cloud. That is, similar in approach to the Automatic Registration step,
except using all data rather than the daisy chain approach.
