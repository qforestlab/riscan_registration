# Overview
The results of MSA + MSA2 are usually quite good, but a quick check is recommended to avoid spending time on instance segmentation of poor point clouds. 
The checks are two-fold:
<br>
i) Analysis of the MSA2 report
<br>
ii) Visual inspection of plot stems cross-section
<br><br>

**1. MSA2 report**
<br>
The results from MSA 2 are usually accurate, but occasionally individual scans
might be poorly co-registered. The starting point for identifying these scans is the
‘full report’ generated by MSA 2 module. These scans can then be viewed in 3D,
and the operator can decide whether they should be included or excluded.
<br><br>
i) Open the corresponding MSA 2 report and review section 4.4.2: Plane
Patches. What you are looking for are substantial spikes in the residuals of distance.
Typically when std(mad) > 0.0015 m. The first figure below is approximately
normal. The second shows a spike in ScanPos146, that requires investigation.

ii) Visualise the scan in question, and neighbouring scans (e.g., in the above
example, 143-150), and colour them by unique values. Switch view type →

You are trying to identify if the scan position is poorly
registered. This can perhaps most readily be found by looking at crosssections
of the point cloud (e.g., using the Height Filter). Particularly focus on
the stems and low-order branches, checking to see if there is any duplication of ghosting
of surfaces. It can be difficult to distinguish between co-registration errors and
effects from wind for high-order branches higher up in the canopy.
<br><br>
iii)If a scan is considered poorly-registered by the operator, then it should be
excluded from the project: *R-click ScanPosXXX → Unregister* (this is not the same
as toggling the ‘registered’ flag)
